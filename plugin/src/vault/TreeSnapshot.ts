/**
 * A per-device copy of the remote TREE (paths + mtime + size, never content),
 * so the next launch can put the vault model back before Obsidian's
 * `metadataCache.initialize()` runs (#513).
 *
 * ## Why this has to exist
 *
 * Obsidian's startup order is `plugins.initialize()` (our `onload`) →
 * `vault.load()` → `metadataCache.initialize()`. That last step walks its
 * IndexedDB cache and, for every cached path that is NOT in the vault model at
 * that moment, calls `deletePath()`, which also deletes it from IndexedDB. The
 * shadow vault's disk holds no notes, and the remote tree only arrives after
 * connect (layout ready or later), so on every start Obsidian threw its whole
 * cache away and then re-read and re-parsed every note once we registered it.
 * Measured by `e2e/scale.spec.ts`: ~23 notes/s, the same on a relaunch as on a
 * cold start.
 *
 * Inserting the tree from here, during `onload`, means `initialize()` finds
 * every note with the same `mtime`/`size` it cached, keeps the entry, and does
 * not read it. The tree is then reconciled against the real remote walk after
 * connect (`BackgroundIndexer`'s reconcile), so a stale snapshot costs a
 * re-read of what changed, never wrong state.
 *
 * Only written after a daemon `fs.walk` (the fast path): the SFTP fallback
 * reports `mtime`/`size` as 0, and a snapshot of zeros would make Obsidian
 * treat every note as unchanged forever.
 *
 * Lives beside `community-plugins.base.json` in
 * `~/.obsidian-remote/state/<profile>/`: per-device, never synced, outside
 * every vault (see `communityPluginsBasePath` in CommunityPluginsSync).
