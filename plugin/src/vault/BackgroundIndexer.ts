/**
 * Indexes the WHOLE remote tree into `vault.fileMap`, in the background, after

 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The lazy connect populate (`main.populateVaultFromRemote` with
 * `lazyFolderLoad`, the default) walks only the root's IMMEDIATE children, and
 * `LazyFolderLoader` deepens a folder only when the user CLICKS it open in File
 * Explorer. That keeps connect fast on a deep, dir-heavy vault — but everything
 * below depth 1 is then *absent from `vault.fileMap` entirely*, and Obsidian's
 * `metadataCache` resolves links only against `fileMap`. So a `[[link]]` into a
 * never-expanded subfolder does not resolve, an image embedded from one does not
 * render, and global search / quick switcher / graph / backlinks silently see a
 * partial vault. Registering the file is enough to fix all of those: once a path
 * lands in `fileMap`, Obsidian re-resolves the links pointing at it on its own.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * - **Fast path** (daemon advertises `fs.walk`): ONE recursive walk. It is
 *   paginated server-side (one RPC per page), so the walk itself is cheap; the
 *   cost that used to freeze Obsidian was *materialising* the entries, which
 *   `buildChunked` already solves. Entries are fed depth-by-depth so a parent
 *   folder is always inserted in an earlier `buildChunked` call than its
 *   children, and so cancellation gets frequent, consistent cut points.
 * - **Fallback path** (SFTP / no daemon): breadth-first, ONE FOLDER AT A TIME.
 *   The fallback costs one `adapter.list` round-trip per directory, so a
 *   dir-heavy tree must trickle rather than stall — walk a folder, build it,
 *   mark it loaded, enqueue its subfolders, yield.
 *
 * Both paths are safe to race the click-driven `LazyFolderLoader` and the live
 * `FsChangeListener`: `VaultModelBuilder`'s inserts skip a path that is already
 * present, so a double-insert is a counted no-op, never a duplicate.
 *
 * File CONTENT is never read — only the tree. (Obsidian's own metadataCache
 * reads the files it cares about; that traffic is its call, not ours.)
