  // ─── community-plugins list round-trip (#429 / #342 / uninstall) ─────────
  //
  // `community-plugins.json` is the *enabled community plugins* list.
  // It deliberately does NOT join SHARED_OBSIDIAN_CONFIG_FILES (whose
  // pull/push copy bytes verbatim): a remote list that omitted
  // `remote-ssh` would, written verbatim, disable the very plugin doing
  // the sync. Instead these two methods round-trip the list so a plugin
  // enabled on one machine reaches another machine's shadow vault and
  // reopening no longer "loses" installed plugins. The marketplace
  // installer re-fetches any binaries the list names but that aren't
  // staged locally yet.
  //
  // Convergence is a 3-WAY MERGE against a per-device BASE snapshot, not
  // a union. The union was MONOTONIC — the list could only ever GROW —
  // so an uninstall on one device never reached the remote, and the next
  // connect's pull RESURRECTED the plugin locally: a fleet-wide uninstall
  // was impossible. A union cannot tell "I never had it" from "I removed
  // it"; only a base can. The base is the converged list as it stood at
  // the END of the last successful round-trip ON THIS DEVICE (see
  // {@link communityPluginsBasePath} for where it lives and why).
  //
  //     added   = local  \ base   -> add to remote
  //     removed = base   \ local  -> remove from remote
  //     added   = remote \ base   -> add to local
  //     removed = base   \ remote -> remove from local
  //
  // Rules, all encoded in {@link mergePluginIds}:
  //
  //  - `remote-ssh` (SELF_PLUGIN_ID) is NEVER removable from either side.
  //  - NO BASE YET (first run, or a shadow vault that was deleted and
  //    re-bootstrapped): a removal is indistinguishable from never-had,
  //    so we fall back to the old UNION. Safe — nothing is lost; removals
  //    simply don't propagate until a base exists, which the first
  //    successful push then writes.
  //  - A device that was OFFLINE while another device removed a plugin
  //    has a stale base, so `base \ remote` sees the removal and drops it
  //    locally. Correct — that is the whole point of the base.
  //  - TIE-BREAK — concurrent ADD on A vs REMOVE on B: **ADD WINS**. It
  //    falls out of the definition: an id in neither the base nor either
  //    side's removal set (`base \ local`, `base \ remote`) is by
  //    definition an addition, and additions are unioned in. Rationale:
  //    re-uninstalling a plugin someone else re-installed is one click;
  //    silently losing a plugin you just installed is invisible data loss.
  //
  // The base is committed by the PUSH only, once BOTH sides hold the
  // converged list. `pullCommunityPlugins` deliberately never writes it:
  // a pull-only caller (`preSpawnPull`) would otherwise record the pulled
  // list as the base, and the push later in the real connect would then
  // read `base \ remote` as a *remote removal* of everything this device
  // had locally added — deleting the user's own additions. Never writing
  // the base on pull also keeps the merge idempotent (a second pull over
  // the same base+remote recomputes the same list), so the
  // pre-spawn-pull → connect-pull → connect-push sequence cannot
  // double-apply a removal.

 * `Panza--work` vs `Panza--dev`) instead of a bare UUID. The id is NOT
 * in the name: identity is resolved from `data.json`'s
 * `autoConnectProfileId` (see `findShadowByProfileId`), so a profile
 * rename or a display-name collision never strands its config.
